In fact, the severity of the cases of coivd 19 could depend on several factors not only age, sex, country but also habit, job.. . How to select the most important factors that affect the covid19 ? How to use them to build a model that can predict from different ages. how to stop spreading of cases? \n\n\nIn order to analzy the various factors effect on infection, evaluate these possibilities by fitting an age-structured mathematical model to epidemic data from as many as countries.   \nCOUNTTY: Country s a factor. (Y/N) \nAGE: Age s a factor. (Y/N) \nScool: Attending school is a factor. (Y/N)  \n"
